<h1>Zoomies</h1>
<p>This is a dog park application created with front-end technologies, such as JavaScript and React, as well as back-end technologies, such as Ruby and Ruby on Rails, and the database management system PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>You can create a profile of yourself and pet dogs, and check in and out at dog parks in NYC. You can also see dogs that are checked in at each dog park with profiles and how busy the dog park is.</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>
This is a collaborative project with another developer, Katey from Flatiron School. Katey and I love dogs and we wanted to make an application relating to them.
</p>
<p>
Katey has a dog called Nori. When she goes to a dog park with him, he wants to play with other dogs. Though, since she is not sure if other dogs are friendly, she cannot let him play with others easily.
In addition, the dog parks are sometimes crowded and she cannot even play with him.</br>
Meanwhile, as a dog lover, I love to go to dog parks and wish I knew what kind of dogs are there.</br>
</p>
<p>
From these experiences, we decided to make this app to help other dog lovers and oweners to improve their dog park activities and solve these difficulties.
